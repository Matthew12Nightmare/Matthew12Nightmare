- 👋 Hi, I’m @Matthew12Nightmare
- 👀 I’m interested in continuing my work as a ordained pastor within the IMVU 3D avatar community as I have for over 10 years, and I was also ordained in Real-Life in 2012. I'm also interested in seeking improvement through continuing my work as a digital light-show DJ with permissions from certain Christian music industry artists to use their works within my ministry and DJ light-shows, including but not limited to B-Shoc.
- 🌱 I’m currently and constantly learning all types of new ways to use code, finding ways to become a better DJ, creating better online 3D animations for DJ light-shows, building websites, how to create more realistic 3D products for my online shop(s).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new ideas and assist in finding new ways to generate possible financial flows. I'm looking for assistance with current technological issues I'm seemingly facing a lot of and moral support, if possible.
- 📫 How to reach me ... https://facebook.com/matthew.imvu.92 OR https://avatars.imvu.com/Matthew12Nightmare OR add Matt12Nightmare#4411 in the Discord app.
- ??? If you're new/noob to the IMVU or DISCORD apps and wish assistance, contact me and I'll kindly attempt to assist you with my current knowledge. I enjoy striving to help people.
